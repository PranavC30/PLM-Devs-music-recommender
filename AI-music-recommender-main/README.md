## 🧠 What Makes This Special?

Most music apps use static algorithms. This app uses **Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning)** — meaning the AI literally gets smarter every time you give feedback. Like a song? The AI remembers. Skip it? It learns that too. Every user gets their own personal AI brain that evolves over time.

## 🎯 How the AI Works

```
User gives feedback (Like / Listen / Skip)
           ↓
    Reward assigned (+10 / +2 / -5)
           ↓
  Q-Learning formula updates Q-Table:
  Q(s,a) = Q(s,a) + α × (r + γ × max Q(s') - Q(s,a))
           ↓
  Next recommendation uses updated Q-values
  (epsilon-greedy: 80% exploit, 20% explore)
```

**State** = `Mood_TimeOfDay_LastGenre`  
**Action** = Genre (Pop, Lo-fi, Rock, Instrumental, Classical)  
**Reward** = Based on user feedback
